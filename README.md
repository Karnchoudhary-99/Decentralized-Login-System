# Decentralized Login System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Login System is a blockchain-based platform designed to securely store and manage project details. By leveraging Ethereum's smart contract technology, this system ensures data integrity, prevents tampering, and enhances transparency.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a decentralized, tamper-proof system for managing critical project information, ensuring that updates are securely recorded and accessible to authorized parties.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized applications (dApps) to expand its usability.
- Implementing role-based access control for better security.
- Adding support for IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store additional project resources.
- Developing a user-friendly frontend interface for easy interaction with the smart contract.

## Key Features
- **Project Creation:** Users can securely create a project with a title and description stored on the blockchain.
- **Project Retrieval:** Users can access project details through a dedicated function.
- **Project Update:** Enables authorized users to update project information securely on the blockchain.
- **Data Integrity:** Blockchain immutability ensures the project's data remains untampered and transparent.
